# Book Paintings
A small web app that helps making paintings in Minecraft books

## How to use this?
To use this application, colour in the top grid using the colours from the pallete. When done, copy the entire grid below that. You'll find your pixels aren't coloured yet, to fix this, you'll have to work by hand. Copy the `ยง` symbol and place it in the locations where it is in the web app, followed by the sign in the web app. You *must* write these following numbers or letters yourself.

## Live application
A live version of the application can be found at https://polysemic-mc.github.io/book-painter/

## Regarding the code
The code is absolutely terrible, writtin in a day. Feel free to make changes and create pull-requests, I'll be rewriting things myself soon.
